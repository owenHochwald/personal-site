# Why You Should Probably Be Reading More Textbooks

YouTube videos taught me how to create basic apps. Short-form content exposed me to new ideas. Documentation taught me syntax. But honestly, I still don't know how most of our technology actually works.

While "boring" to some, the thing I've been enjoying the most and feeling the most value from has been old-school CS textbooks.

## The Problem with Surface-Level Learning

Modern software development learning often focuses on the "how" without diving into the "why." We learn frameworks and tools, but rarely understand the fundamental principles that make them work. This creates a fragile knowledge base that crumbles when faced with novel problems.

## My Textbook Revelation

I spent my plane ride from Vancouver back to DC after the semester, completely dialed in, just reading CS textbooks on my laptop. It was one of the most productive and enjoyable flights I've ever had.

What makes textbooks so valuable?

### Deep Understanding Over Quick Fixes

- **They go MUCH deeper than any tutorials**: While a YouTube video might show you how to implement a feature, textbooks explain the underlying principles.
- **They literally synergize with everything**: Understanding fundamentals makes every other technology easier to grasp.
- **They force you to think, not just consume**: Practice exercises ensure you're actively learning, not passively watching.
- **They expose you to ideas you wouldn't search for**: You discover concepts you didn't even know existed.

## Learning Without Pressure

One of the best things about reading textbooks in your free time is that it's actually fun. There's no pressure from classes, exams, or deadlines. You can:

- Go at your own pace
- Skip sections that aren't relevant
- Dive deeper into topics that interest you
- Apply concepts immediately to your projects

The synergy you get from learning fundamentals helps with literally everything you do in software development.

## Addressing the Skeptics

Some people argue that textbook material is too niche or not directly relevant to "modern software development."

**I don't buy that.** Especially after giving it a try myself.

Everything we use today is built on those fundamentals. Understanding things at a lower level has only made backend, systems, and ML work easier for me, not harder.

### The Foundation Matters

- Every web framework builds on networking principles
- Every database query relies on data structures and algorithms
- Every distributed system depends on concepts from systems programming
- Every optimization requires understanding of computer architecture

## Getting Started

I haven't even taken a networking class yet, but reading the textbook on my own is already setting me ahead. You can literally find a textbook about anything—from system design to React to compilers. It's all up to you.

### My Current Reading List

Here are a few I've been enjoying and would recommend:

1. **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** by Martin Kleppmann
   - _Thanks to Alice He for the recommendation!_
   - Perfect for understanding modern distributed systems and databases

2. **Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach** by Kurose and Ross
   - Comprehensive introduction to networking fundamentals
   - Clear explanations with practical examples

3. **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** by Bryant and O'Hallaron
   - Deep dive into how computers actually work
   - Essential for systems programming and optimization

---

## The Challenge

If you've been relying solely on tutorials, documentation, and quick videos, I challenge you to pick up a textbook in an area you want to improve. Give it a genuine shot.

You might be surprised at how much more confident you feel in your understanding—and how much more enjoyable deep learning can be compared to surface-level content consumption.

### Questions for Reflection

- What fundamental concepts are you currently missing in your technology stack?
- How might deeper understanding of low-level systems improve your day-to-day development work?
